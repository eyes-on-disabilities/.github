## Moin 👋

We are [Eyes on (Dis)Abilites](https://gaming.ifb-stiftung.de/eyes-on-disabilities-home/) and we want to provide low-cost eye-tracking solutions to paraplegics and ALS patients.
This is a cooperation between the [Chaos Computer Club Wiesbaden e.V.](https://www.cccwi.de) and [Gaming and (Dis)Abilities](https://gaming.ifb-stiftung.de/eyes-on-disabilities-home/).
